Where Abstractions are Used:

Abstract Classes (Person and Content): The Person class abstracts the common properties and behavior of both instructors and students, promoting code reusability. Similarly, the Content class abstracts the common features of courses and assignments, allowing for a unified approach to handling content in the LMS.

Inheritance (User, Student, Course, and Assignment): Inheritance is used to model the "is-a" relationship. For example, a Student is a specialized form of a User, and a Course is a specialized form of Content. This enhances code organization and readability.

Polymorphism: The showDetails method is defined in both Person and Content classes, and it is overridden in the subclasses (User, Student, Course, and Assignment). This demonstrates polymorphism, allowing different objects to be treated uniformly when displaying their details.

By introducing these abstractions, the code becomes more modular and extensible, making it easier to add new functionalities or adapt to future changes in the LMS requirements.
